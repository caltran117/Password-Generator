# <Password-generator>

## Description

This project will generate a randomized code based on the users input for characters length and character type.
I wanted to learn how to use JavaScript to produce a randomized output based my conditions I had set and to link that to the html and CSS.
This project was built for anyone who would want to generate a random password and it solves the problem of having to make a password manually.
I had learned how to use JavaScript functions use the for code to produce randomness.
